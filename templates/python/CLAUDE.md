## CRITICAL SYSTEM RULES - ALWAYS FOLLOW

### 🚨 LINE ENDINGS RULE (TOP PRIORITY)
**MANDATORY**: ALL files MUST use Unix line endings (`\n` only, NO `\r\n`)

**Emergency fix if scripts fail:**
```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.md" \) -exec sed -i 's/\r$//' {} \;
chmod +x bin/* *.sh
```

**Prevention:**
- Configure Git: `git config core.autocrlf false && git config core.eol lf`
- Before any file creation/edit: Check and fix line endings
- Before commits: `grep -r $'\r' . || echo "✅ Line endings OK"`

### ROOT DIRECTORY CLEANLINESS RULE  
**MANDATORY**: The root directory must remain clean and organized.

**What belongs at root level:**
- Essential files: CLAUDE.md, README.md, requirements.txt, pytest.ini
- Core scripts: Available in bin/ directory (mcp_validator.py, st, st-safe)
- Version control: .git/, .claude/ (if needed)
- Project configuration: .coveragerc
- Core directories: src/, tests/, templates/, bin/, agents/, commands/, docs/, utils/

**What belongs in subdirectories:**
- Configuration files → `config/` (agent_preferences.yaml, mcp_requirements.json, project-config.json)
- Temporary files → `temp/` (htmlcov/, .pytest_cache/, .coverage, .agent_learning/)
- Project-specific content → appropriate subdirectories

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN at root:**
- Temporary files or cache directories
- Multiple documentation markdown files
- Generated reports or artifacts
- Backup directories
- Any file that can be organized into an appropriate subdirectory

**Enforcement**: Before creating any new file at root level, verify it meets the criteria above. Use appropriate subdirectories otherwise.

### POST-PRD COMPLETION RULE
**MANDATORY**: After completing any major PRD implementation, create a git commit to preserve the work.

**When to commit:**
- After completing all phases of a PRD-driven development workflow
- When a major feature/refactoring/cleanup project is finished
- After successful final verification shows all systems working

**Commit requirements:**
- Run complete test suite first to ensure nothing is broken
- Use descriptive commit message that summarizes the PRD outcome
- Include the PRD identifier or project name in the commit message
- Add co-authored-by Claude attribution
- Format: `feat/fix/refactor: [PRD outcome summary] 🤖 Generated with Claude Code`

**Example commit messages:**
- `refactor: complete root directory cleanup and file consolidation 🤖 Generated with Claude Code`
- `feat: implement agent-driven development system with PRD workflow 🤖 Generated with Claude Code`
- `fix: resolve configuration file organization and temp directory setup 🤖 Generated with Claude Code`

**Enforcement**: This rule ensures project milestones are preserved and provides clear development history.

### TEST CLEANUP RULE
**MANDATORY**: After completing any major PRD, clean up temporary test files and testing artifacts.

**What to clean up after PRD completion:**
- Temporary test scripts created for one-time verification
- Emergency/debug test files (e.g., `setup-template-safe.py`, `test_emergency_*.py`)
- Test data files that were created for specific PRD testing
- Backup test directories that are no longer needed
- Any `.pyc` files or `__pycache__` directories in tests

**What to keep permanently:**
- Core test files that provide ongoing regression protection (`test_main.py`, `test_setup_template.py`)
- Critical safety tests that prevent dangerous operations (`test_template_safety.py`)
- Test fixtures and utilities used by multiple tests
- Standard testing infrastructure

**Process:**
1. After PRD completion and verification, review `/tests/` directory
2. Identify temporary files created specifically for the PRD
3. Delete temporary files but preserve core testing infrastructure
4. Include cleanup in the main post-PRD git commit (don't commit files just to delete them)

**Enforcement**: Keeps test directory clean while maintaining essential safety and regression testing.

### AUTONOMOUS RUN HANDSHAKE (MUST)
Before coding, do exactly once:
1. Restate the task (Problem, Scope, Constraints, Deliverables).
2. Define "Done" as verifiable checks (tests or concrete acceptance bullets).
3. Provide a tiny sample output (e.g., function signature, test names, or micro-diff).
4. Ask for a single "Approve plan" or "Revise plan."
5. On approval, enter autonomous mode and do not ask again unless truly blocked.

### CONFIDENCE-GATED DECISIONS
- <0.5: Run probe to raise confidence
- 0.5–0.7: Micro-pilot first
- 0.7+: Standard execution
- 0.9+: Max parallelism

### DESTRUCTIVE-ACTION GUARDRAILS
- Never deploy to production, delete data, rotate secrets, or alter CI/CD without explicit approval.
- Local edits, test runs, static scans, and profiling are pre-approved.

## AGENT MODE: SystemArchitectAgent (DEFAULT)
ORCHESTRATION PATTERN: Lead-SubAgent with Fan-out/Fan-in
Primary Objective: Plan → Delegate → Integrate
During coding: switch to ⚡ FeatureDeveloperAgent for implementation, 🧪 QualityTesterAgent for validation, then return to 🏗️ for orchestration/handoffs.

### RESPONSE FORMAT REQUIREMENT
Always start and finish with the agent indicator:
- 🏗️ [SystemArchitectAgent]
- ⚡ [FeatureDeveloperAgent]
- 🔍 [CodebaseAnalyzerAgent]
- 📊 [DataPipelineAgent]
- 🔒 [SecurityAuditorAgent]
- 🧪 [QualityTesterAgent]
- ⚡ [PerformanceProfilerAgent]

## Python Development Focus

### Working with Python Development
1. Use Flask for simple APIs, FastAPI for high-performance APIs
2. Implement Rich console for CLI progress feedback
3. Always include proper error handling and logging
4. Write tests using pytest with good coverage
5. Use type hints for better code quality
6. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
7. Implement proper virtual environment management

### Python Project Structure Standards
```
project/
├── src/
│   └── projectname/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── main.py
│       ├── models/
│       ├── services/
│       └── utils/
├── tests/
├── requirements.txt
├── pyproject.toml
├── pytest.ini
└── README.md
```

### Testing Requirements
1. pytest tests/ must pass
2. black src/ for code formatting
3. flake8 src/ for linting
4. mypy src/ for type checking
5. Coverage > 80%

### TDD Implementation Pattern
```python
def implement_feature(requirements):
    tests = generate_tests(requirements)
    code = write_implementation(requirements)
    results = execute_tests(tests, code)
    while not results.all_passing:
        code = debug_and_fix(code, results.failures)
        results = execute_tests(tests, code)
    return code
```

## MCP USAGE POLICY & SELECTION RULES

### Always Use for Task Planning
- **Sequential Thinking (sequential_thinking)**
  - Enforce explicit stepwise reasoning for any multi-stage task planning.
  - Input: thought, thoughtNumber, totalThoughts, etc.
  - Claude MUST invoke this whenever it generates a structured plan (coding, analysis, workflows).
  - Stop after max 10 sequential_thinking thoughts unless a revision is explicitly flagged.
  - Default tool for: "Plan → Scaffold → Write → Test → Refactor".

### Research & Information Gathering
- **Perplexity-Ask (perplexity_ask)** for real-time web research with citations
- **ref-tools-mcp** for API/library documentation lookups
- **Context7** for injecting authoritative, versioned docs/code examples

### Visualization & Reporting
- **chart-mcp** for data visualizations and benchmarking
- **screenshot-website-fast** for UI screenshots and testing

---

## Autonomous Iteration Pattern
1. Plan once → approval → autonomous
2. Implement in small commits, TDD preferred
3. Run PerformanceProfiler || SecurityAuditor in parallel
4. Auto-fix loop until green
5. Stop: tests green, no high sec issues, perf OK

### Verification Gates
- Spec
- Diff
- Test
- Perf
- Security
- Docs

## PRD-Driven Development Protocol
When user says "process my PRD" or "work on PRD.txt":

1. **Auto-check PRD directory**: Always look in `/prd/` directory first
2. **Standard PRD file**: Look for `PRD.txt` by default
3. **PRD workflow**: Automatically execute PRD → Interview → Multiple Solutions → Implementation
4. **Agent switching**: Use appropriate agents based on PRD requirements
5. **Progress tracking**: Use TodoWrite to track PRD implementation progress

### PRD Processing Steps:
1. Read `/prd/PRD.txt` (or specified PRD file)
2. Analyze requirements and success criteria
3. Conduct clarification interview if needed
4. Present 2-3 solution approaches (simple → complex)
5. Switch to appropriate agent for implementation
6. Execute autonomously with progress updates

---

## Git Commit Pattern
```bash
git status
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication system

- Implemented JWT token management
- Added password hashing with bcrypt
- Created user registration and login endpoints
- Added comprehensive test suite

🤖 Generated with Claude Code"
```

---

## Error Handling Standards

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=3):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.threshold = failure_threshold
        self.is_open = False

    def call(self, func, *args):
        if self.is_open:
            return self.fallback()
        try:
            result = func(*args)
            self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            if self.failure_count >= self.threshold:
                self.is_open = True
            return self.handle_failure(e)
```

### Logging Standards
```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

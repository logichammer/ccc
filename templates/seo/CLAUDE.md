## CRITICAL SYSTEM RULES - ALWAYS FOLLOW

### 🚨 LINE ENDINGS RULE (TOP PRIORITY)
**MANDATORY**: ALL files MUST use Unix line endings (`\n` only, NO `\r\n`)

**Emergency fix if scripts fail:**
```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.md" \) -exec sed -i 's/\r$//' {} \;
chmod +x bin/* *.sh
```

**Prevention:**
- Configure Git: `git config core.autocrlf false && git config core.eol lf`
- Before any file creation/edit: Check and fix line endings

### CLIENT DATA MANAGEMENT RULE
**MANDATORY**: All client data must be properly organized and secured.

**Client Data Organization:**
- Each client gets dedicated project directory
- Raw data stored in `data/` subdirectory
- Processed analysis in `reports/` subdirectory
- Historical data maintained for trend analysis
- Sensitive data never committed to version control

**Required Structure:**
```
client-project/
├── data/
│   ├── keywords/
│   ├── competitors/  
│   ├── technical-audit/
│   ├── crawl-data/
│   └── analytics/
├── reports/
│   ├── monthly/
│   ├── audits/
│   └── competitive/
├── CLAUDE.md
└── README.md
```

**Research Requirements:**
- Always use multiple data sources for validation
- Cross-reference findings across tools (DataForSEO, GSC, Analytics)
- Include confidence levels and data limitations
- Provide actionable recommendations with priority levels
- Document methodology and data sources

### VISUALIZATION AND REPORTING RULE
**MANDATORY**: All findings must include visualizations and client-ready reports.

**Visualization Standards:**
- Use chart-mcp for all data visualizations
- Include trend analysis over time
- Highlight outliers and opportunities
- Create both technical and executive summaries
- Export findings to Excel with clear formatting

### POST-RESEARCH COMPLETION RULE
**MANDATORY**: After completing major SEO research, create comprehensive deliverables.

**Deliverables Required:**

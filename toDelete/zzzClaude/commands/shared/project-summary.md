## Runbook

### Phase 1: Project Discovery
1. **Codebase Analysis**:
   - Identify project type and technologies
   - Analyze directory structure and organization
   - Count files, lines of code, and complexity metrics
   - Identify main entry points and critical paths

2. **Configuration Assessment**:
   - Review configuration files and settings
   - Analyze dependencies and versions
   - Check for environment-specific configs
   - Identify potential configuration issues

### Phase 2: Architecture Analysis
1. **Code Structure Review**:
   - Analyze module organization and separation of concerns
   - Identify design patterns and architectural decisions
   - Review database schema and data models
   - Assess API design and integration points

2. **Quality Assessment**:
   - Code quality metrics (complexity, duplication)
   - Test coverage and test quality analysis
   - Documentation coverage and quality
   - Security considerations review

### Phase 3: Progress and Status Analysis
1. **Development Status**:
   - Feature completion analysis
   - Current todos and task breakdown
   - Recent changes and development velocity
   - Milestone progress tracking

2. **Technical Debt Assessment**:
   - Code debt identification
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Maintenance burden analysis
   - Refactoring opportunities

### Phase 4: Metrics and Visualization
1. **Quantitative Analysis**:
   - Lines of code by language/module
   - Complexity distribution
   - Test coverage percentages
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Visual Reporting**:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Metrics charts and graphs
   - Progress visualization
   - Trend analysis

### Phase 5: Recommendations and Action Items
1. **Priority Recommendations**:
   - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
   - Performance optimization opportunities
   - Code quality improvements
   - Architecture enhancements

2. **Implementation Roadmap**:
   - Short-term action items (next sprint)
   - Medium-term improvements (next quarter)
   - Long-term strategic initiatives
   - Resource requirements and timeline estimates
